# react-pdf-tailwind-repl

A Repl based on [diegomura/react-pdf-site](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf-site) with [react-pdf-tailwind](https://github.com/aanckar/react-pdf-tailwind)

## Getting started

- run `pnpm install & pnpm run dev`

## TODO

- [ ] Improve mobile GUI
- [ ] Add a way to add your own tailwind config from the GUI
- [ ] Add a way to add your own fonts from the GUI
- [ ] Add a way to share your code (like react-pdf's repl has)
